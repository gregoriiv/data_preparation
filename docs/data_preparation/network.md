# Network
HowTo for preparation of Points of Network to GOAT database format.  
  
All settings for the subsequent preprocessing of the data are used by the file **_config.yaml_**. The **"ways"** section provides settings for **_"collection"_, _"preparation"_** and **_"fusion"_** in the corresponding categories. 
In the header of the configuration file there is an attribute _**"region_pbf"**_ in which as a list the regions for which the data collection and preparation will be performed. 
_!!! WARNING Be careful with the choice of region! Too large size and as a consequence, a large amount of data in the OSM for the region may significantly load the operating memory of the computer used and end in failure of the operation.!!!_  
## Collection/Preparation
### Collection
In the **collection** block nothing should be specified. Data will be collected and stored in local GOAT database.
### Preparation
In the **preparation** block located variables which define network preparation process.

### Execution of Collection and Preparation
 - See chapter **Quick Start - Command Line**

### Manual execution of function for Collection
Collection can be done manually with function **_network_collection()_** , which returns nothing, but stores collected data in local GOAT database. Variable **_conf_** by default is **ways** can be specified. Variable **_database_** by default is local GOAT database, but can be specified manually as well.

### Manual execution of function for Preparation
Preparation of data also is possible to execute manually with the creation of class enitity **_PrepareLayers('ways')_**. Then it is neccesary to execute function to created entity with function **_ways()_** which executes all preparation steps for network and stores it in table **ways** in local GOAT database.
